| Wide   | 1024       | 256         |
| Square | 500        | 500         |

Once you've done and clicked the **Create** button, a MetaMask window will pop-up. You can click on **Confirm** to proceed. The gas fee will be in Matic and the transaction might take a while.

You'll received a MetaMask pop-up notification when the transaction is done. The other way to check is to go to your Campaigns page and you'll see the campaign you've created listed on the page.
