# Create a Campaign

Campaigns are your gateway to exposure in the metaverse. Here's what you'll need to do:
1. [Connect to the Blockchain](#connect-to-the-blockchain)
2. [Setup your Campaign](#create-a-campaign)
3. [Mint an NFT that represents your Campaign](#confirm-your-campaign-on-the-blockchain)

## 1. Connect to the Blockchain

You'll need to connect to the blockchain to get market data and mint your Campaign token. Currently, we use [Polygon](https://polygon.technology), which is a low-fee, low-carbon impact Ethereum sidechain.


1. Make sure your wallet is set to the Polygon network and press **Connect**

1. Click on **Campaigns**

Ensure that your campaign image format matches the Zesty space's banner format. Below are the dimensions of the supported assets (width x height):

| Format | Width (px) | Height (px) |
| ------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| Tall   | 768        | 1024        |
| Wide   | 1024       | 256         |
| Square | 500        | 500         |
| Twitch | 550        | 200         |
</details>

## 3. Confirm your Campaign on the blockchain

Once you've done and clicked the **Create** button, a MetaMask window will pop-up. You can click on **Confirm** to proceed. The gas fee will be in Matic and the transaction might take a while.

You'll received a MetaMask pop-up notification when the transaction is done. The other way to check is to go to your Campaigns page and you'll see the campaign you've created listed on the page.

Now that you have your Campaign set-up, you're ready to start bidding on the timeslot of the creator of your choice.
