# Refunds

If the advertisement was not successfully displayed you will be refunded a majority of your USDC, though some USDC will be taken by the network for fees.

This fee is also meant to discourage malicious advertisers from repeatedly putting campaigns that publishers do not desire, effectively causing a denial of service for the publisher. The fees will make the denial of service expensive for a malicious advertiser.
