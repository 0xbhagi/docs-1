# Bid on Timeslots

Virtual space owners list prices for some amount of time on their banners. Advertisers can bid on these timeslots and, if approved by the owner, be set up to automatically occupy and pay for that period of time.

Here's what you'll need to do:

- [Bid on Timeslots](#bid-on-timeslots)

  - [2. Bid on a timeslot](#2-bid-on-a-timeslot)
  - [3. Submit your purchase](#3-submit-your-purchase)

## 1. Find a Space

When connected to the blockchain, you can find all active an inactive listings in the [Billboard Market](https://app.zesty.market/).

Choose the space you desire. For the purpose of this guide, we'll use Zesty Ad Demo space.

:::tip due diligence
Before you buy, check out the Space's **Analytics** tab. It will show a history of their *clicks* and *visits*

## 3. Submit your purchase

Purchasing your first timeslot will require both an **approval** and **submission**.

On both actions, you'll be greeted with MetaMask pop-ups. Both will require a small amount of gas fees. Click on confirm on both occasions.

## 4. Wait for owner approval

Space owners need to approve your bid before the purchase goes through. They will be able to see all of your Campaign's details before making a decision.

Watch your approval status in the Space's **Auctions** tab. If they accept, your campaign will appear in their space for the time specified in the auction.
